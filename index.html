        <p>Youtubers Life is a life simulation game with business simulation elements, and influences from the Game Dev Tycoon and The Sims video games.[1] The player has to manage a character trying to build a career as a YouTube personality.[2] In addition to managing the creation of videos for their channel, the player must also manage the character's education and social life.[1][2] As the character develops, the player also must manage the character's employees and growing content network. Opportunities to create videos for friends, creating videos through advertising agreements, and the revenue generated by each video's ads enable the character to purchase upgrades to their equipment and housing, and access resources to level up their character's skills.[2]</p>
